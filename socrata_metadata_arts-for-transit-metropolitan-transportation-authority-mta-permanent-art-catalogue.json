Both well-established and emerging artists contribute to the growing collection of works created in the materials of the system -mosaic, ceramic, tile, bronze, steel and glass.

The historic  mosaic patterns that ran along the station's walls were water damaged and on the brink of permanent loss.

Tunick's art celebrates the vintage ceramic ornamentation of the station and is inspired by her fascination with terra cotta and her childhood memories of nearby Prospect Park and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.  Tunick says her works for the sites, collectively titled {Brighton Clay Re-Leaf, Nos.1-4}, balance her respect for the stations' ceramic history, her recollection of the colors and shapes of the foliage in the park and garden, and her desire to add eye-catching modern design, which is achieved in her use of bold color, pattern, and texture in the tiles.", "count": "2"}, {"item": "Tomie Arai's {Back to the Garden} consists of 24 faceted glass windows at Pelham Parkway in the Bronx.

Highlighting the historic nature of the station and the community, Arai insets historic black and white photographs into her colorful images.  The photos have been screened and fired onto the glass surface.  Taken from archival photographs, they span the period from 1899 to 1969 and capture views of the surrounding streets and buildings.

Elsewhere, Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey, Paul Robeson, John Coltrane, and Thelonious Monk express themselves, rejoining the community where the Harlem Renaissance all began.

Light is a major theme of the piece, especially the burst of light that envelops a subway train when it leaves an underground tunnel and becomes elevated. African and Native American influences are integral to the work, as are arch shapes suggested by tunnels and 'els.'

Nearby, Paul Robeson, Marcus Garvey and a young Thurgood Marshall appear.

The artist team worked from photographs of individuals moving around the city and in and out of the subway.  According to the artists, the title of {Carrying On} can be read in a variety of ways.  People on the streets of New York are almost always carrying something, sometimes something huge and outlandish.  After the 9/11 tragedy, New Yorkers felt that they must carry on with their lives.  Finally, New Yorkers are notoriously opinionated and lively; they really do 'carry on.'  The result is a linear narrative work of miniature figures, each of whom has a story it is up to the viewer to discern.

A painter, sculptor and printmaker, Kushner has always been fascinated by organic motifs.

Through the artist's lighthearted use of Chinese-derived icons, the tiles illustrate aspects of the then-new trade with Asia and celebrates today's Chinatown.  On the platforms, interlocking teapots incorporate the Chinese symbol for good life.  Other symbols, on the station's upper level, are variations on the symbols for Asia, quality, and cycle.

Trees and sky seem real; the space appears to expand and depth is convincingly suggested.  In the artist's words, I envisioned an imaginary room revealed behind the sliding tile walls - a quiet, restful space with a radiant view to the outside, a room of tranquility.  I wanted the room to have illusionary windows that would seem to let the outside world penetrate into the station.  Brandt rose to the challenge of responding to the site with a work that relates to Acconci's in counterpoint.

Other images are the  Montauk lighthouse and a sailboat.  Zucker's fanciful images - the bluefish is green, the potato is blue - are rendered in faceted glass, equally powerful day and night.  Says Zucker; I hope that this piece brings travelers enjoyment, that it gives them memories and of Long Island and moments of pleasure.

The artist says, The identity of each face is specific, never to be repeated, even over thousands of generations, like the delicate changes of any flower's colors and shapes as it adapts to the Sun's motion...The face can be a portrait or a stylized fantasy - even when I'm making a portrait of an individual.
