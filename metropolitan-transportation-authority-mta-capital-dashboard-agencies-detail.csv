After award of all construction contracts, remaining funds have been shifted to extend construction management and construction support services and more recently address additional design changes and project management costs.   Furthermore, the reserve was lowered in the 3rd Quarter 2014 to provide additional contract contingency for Systems & Finishes.   This amount reflects an agreed upon settlement with the contractor and resolve open claims and change orders. Recently, the reserves were replenished reflecting HYDC's approval for non-subway related work.",,,,,,1411,1411
